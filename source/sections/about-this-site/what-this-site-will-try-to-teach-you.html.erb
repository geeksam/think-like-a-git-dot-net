title: What This Site Will Try to Teach You

<p>My goal is to give you <strong>a simple strategy for safely experimenting</strong> with some of the features that make Git so insanely, awesomely useful.</p>

<p>In order to do that, I need to make sure you know at least a little tiny bit about graph theory.  <em><strong>Don't be intimidated by this!</strong></em>  I hope you'll find, as I did, that graph theory just gives you a convenient place to hang a lot of concepts you're already familiar with.</p>

<p>Once I've introduced graph theory, I'll show you how it applies to Git, and I'll share my "Git epiphany" with you.</p>

<p>Finally, I'll explain the pattern I use to this day in working with Git repositories.</p>
