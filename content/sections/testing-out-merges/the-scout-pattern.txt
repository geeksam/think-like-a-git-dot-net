Here's a quick overview of the steps in this recipe:

<ol class="full-size">
  <li>Make sure you're on the right branch and that you have a clean working state.</li>
  <li>Create a new branch (I often name it <em>test_merge</em>) and switch to it.</li>
  <li>Do the merge.</li>
  <li>Switch to your visualizer and predict how its view will change when you refresh it.</li>
  <li>Refresh your visualizer and see whether your prediction was correct.</li>
  <li>Are you happy with the result?
    <ul>
      <li>If YES: Move your real branch forward to where the <em>test_merge</em> branch is.</li>
      <li>If NO: Delete the <em>test_merge</em> branch.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

I call this the Scout pattern:  you're unsure what the terrain ahead is like, so you send a scouting party ahead to check it out.  If they radio back that everything's okay, you'll move ahead and join them.  If not, well, it was just a small scouting party and we'll tell the families that they died with honor...

<h3>The long version</h3>

You're on the ***master*** branch and you want the changes from the ***spiffy_new_feature*** branch to be incorporated into ***master.***  You're not sure if this will be a good idea, so you want to try out the merge, but be able to abort it if things don't go smoothly.

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Make sure you're on the right branch and that you have a clean working state.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whatever visualizer you're using, figure out how it shows you where your current branch is.  Or, at the command line, type <code class="inline">git status</code> and you should see something like this:
        <code>
          # On branch master <br />
          nothing to commit (working directory clean)
        </code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create a new branch and switch to it.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Type <code class="inline">git checkout -b test_merge</code>.  Now, if you type <code class="inline">git status</code> again, you should see a message that you're on the <em><strong>test_merge</strong></em> branch.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do the merge.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Type <code class="inline">git merge spiffy_new_feature</code>.  If you're lucky, there won't be any merge conflicts you can't resolve.
      </li>
      <li><strong>If you want to abort the merge</strong> at this point, type <code class="inline">git reset --hard</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Switch to your visualizer and predict how its view will change when you refresh it.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For example:
        <ol>
          <li>After a merge, you should see a new commit.</li>
          <li>The new commit should have a message like "Merge branch 'spiffy_new_feature' into test_merge".</li>
          <li>Your <em><strong>test_merge</strong></em> branch label should have moved to this new commit, while the <em><strong>master</strong></em> and <em><strong>spiffy_new_feature</strong></em> branch labels should still be in the same place.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Refresh your visualizer and see whether your prediction was correct.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Are you happy with the result?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>If YES:</strong> Move the <em>master</em> branch forward to where the <em>test_merge</em> branch is with:
        <code>git checkout master <br />git merge test_merge</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If NO:</strong> Drop the <em>test_merge</em> branch with:
        <code>git checkout master <br />git branch -D test_merge</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
