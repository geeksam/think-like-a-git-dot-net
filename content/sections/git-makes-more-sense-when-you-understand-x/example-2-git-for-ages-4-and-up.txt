In [Git for Ages 4 And Up](http://2010.osdc.com.au/proposal/196/git-ages-4-and) (OSDC, 2010), Michael Schwern uses Tinker Toys to teach the audience how Git works.

It's a brilliant talk by a brilliant developer, and if you have some time to watch the video, I highly recommend it.  But check out the very first sentence in the session description *(emphasis added)*:

> ***Git makes so much more sense when you understand how it really works,*** because it's really a two trick pony.
> <br /> <br />
> Tinker Toys are the best illustration of a Git repository I've found. Side-by-side with issuing Git commands, we'll build a Git repository out of kid's toys showing what's going on behind the scenes. Mind bending concepts like remote branching, rebase and the staging area become child's play.
