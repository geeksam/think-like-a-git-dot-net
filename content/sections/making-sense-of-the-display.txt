Here's another look at that GitX screenshot, with a few annotations.

<div class="wp-caption">
  <img src="/assets/images2/gitx-visualization-annotated.png" class="no-shadow" />
  <br /><strong>If you want a dummy repo to play around with, <a href="https://github.com/geeksam/do-re-mi">clone this one</a>.</strong>
</div>

The important thing to know about this, though, isn't what you see here.  It's what you **don't** see.  Every Git tool I've ever seen shares one thing in common:  **they hide commits from you**.

Sounds like a conspiracy theory, right?  Not really.
