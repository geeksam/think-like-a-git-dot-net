When I first started using Git, I was really paranoid about losing code.  I'd come from a Subversion background, where branching is this arcane thing that causes all kinds of trouble, so I didn't have a lot of practice with merging -- let alone rebasing, which everyone said was really dangerous.  (Remember <%= section_link('LSD and chainsaws') %>?)

So, before I tried something I was a little uncertain about, ***I would back up the entire directory.***

<code>
  $ cd ..<br />
  $ cp -r work backup_work<br />
  $ cd work
</code>

Then I'd do the merge, or rebase, or whatever it was that I thought was tricky.  If it looked like it worked, I'd continue on; if not, I'd delete the working directory, rename the old one, and try something else.

I don't have records, but I'm pretty sure I did this for at least my first year of working with Git.

At some point, I realized that, whenever I did this, I was always worried about screwing up some branch that I cared about, and not being able to recover my precious code.  When I finally realized that <%= section_link('references make commits reachable') %>, I (a) felt very dumb for all those times I backed up the repository, and (b) developed a much faster strategy for getting my repository back to a known state.
