As previously mentioned there are a few different kinds of references, and they all point to commits in your repository.  The only difference between them is how and when they move.  (When I say that a reference moves, I mean that the ID of the commit that it points to is updated.)

**Local branch references** are specific to a single repository:  your local one.  Commands that affect local branch references include
  <code class="inline">commit</code>,
  <code class="inline">merge</code>,
  <code class="inline">rebase</code>, and
  <code class="inline">reset</code>.

**Remote branch references** are also specific to a single repository, but one that's previously been defined as a remote.  Commands that affect remote branch references include
  <code class="inline">fetch</code> and
  <code class="inline">push</code>.

**Tag references** are basically like branch references that never move.  **Once you've created a tag, it will never change** (unless you explicitly update it using the <code class="inline">--force</code> option).  This behavior makes them useful for marking specific versions of a software package, or marking exactly what got deployed to a production server on a particular date.  As of this writing, I only know of one command that affects tags.  As you might guess, it's
  <code class="inline">tag</code>.
