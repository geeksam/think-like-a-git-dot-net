My goal is to give you **a simple strategy for safely experimenting** with some of the features that make Git so insanely, awesomely useful.

In order to do that, I need to make sure you know at least a little tiny bit about **graph theory.**  ***Don't be intimidated by this!***  I hope you'll find, as I did, that graph theory just gives you a convenient place to hang a lot of concepts you're already familiar with.

Once I've introduced graph theory, I'll show you how it applies to Git, and I'll share with you what I call "the Git epiphany."

Finally, I'll explain the pattern I use to this day in working with Git repositories.
