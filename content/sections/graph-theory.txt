**[If you're already comfortable with graph theory, skip ahead to <%= section_link('Reachability') %>.]**

For a rather math-intensive introduction to graph theory, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">see Wikipedia</a>.  Here's a very short version of the definition they use there:

> A graph refers to a collection of nodes and a collection of edges that connect pairs of nodes.

Graph theory can be used to describe a lot of things, but I'll start off with one of the most straightforward examples:  maps.  You can think of graph theory as a way of encoding information about two aspects of a map:  **places to go, and ways to get there.**

Let's start at the very beginning, shall we?

*[By the way:  as important human inventions go, I happen to think graph theory is right up there alongside bacon and indoor plumbing.  It takes some time to really sink in, though, so **if you find your eyes glazing over in this section, don't worry about it**.  As long as the page about <%= page_link('reachability', 'reachability') %> makes sense to you, you can come back and reread these pages later.]*
