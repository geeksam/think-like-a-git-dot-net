    <a href="http://hginit.com/00.html">Subversion Re-Education</a> on the HgInit site
    <div class="reading-note">
      It's a site about Mercurial (another distributed version control system), but this one page is incredibly useful if you're coming to Git from Subversion or another centralized system.
