<h2>Software</h2>

  <li>
    <a href="http://gitx.laullon.com/">GitX (L)</a>
    <div class="reading-note">
      The <a href="https://github.com/pieter/gitx/wiki/">original version of GitX</a> stalled out at v0.7.1 (though I've continued happily using it), and the GitHub readme now refers you to this version instead.  Looks like it's added some nice features; I'll have to check it out! (I've heard good things about the <a href="https://github.com/brotherbard/gitx">brotherbard fork</a>, but that also appears to have stalled.) Thanks to <%= twitter_user('hugocf') %> for cluing me in!

    <a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/">Tig: text-mode interface for git</a> by <a href="http://jonasfonseca.com/">Jonas Fonseca</a>
    <div class="reading-note">
      Also suggested by <a href="http://markscholtz.com/">Mark Scholtz</a>, this is a text-mode UI that gives you pretty (but still text-based) views of many of the same things that GitX does.  I personally don't have a lot of use for this, but for those of you who really really love your CLI (or your screen readers!), this might fit your working style a bit better.

    <div class="reading-note">
      Explains why you might want to use Git, and why it has some of the features it has.  At end, provides links to a few other resources that may be useful.

    <a href="http://hginit.com/00.html">Subversion Re-Education</a> page on a Mercurial tutorial site by Joel&nbsp;Spolsky
    <div class="reading-note">
      Mercurial is a different distributed version control system, but this one page is incredibly useful if you're coming to Git from Subversion or another centralized system.

    <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git">The Thing About Git</a> 2008 blog post by Ryan&nbsp;Tomayko

    <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">Git Immersion</a> by EdgeCase Consulting
    <div class="reading-note">
      This one was suggested by reader <a href="http://markscholtz.com/">Mark Scholtz</a>.  I haven't gone through it myself, but at first glance this looks like an amazingly detailed, well supported step-by-step tutorial that starts from the very basics and goes on through some very advanced topics.  Thanks, Mark!

    <a href="http://progit.org/">Pro Git</a>, occasional blog and 2009 book by Scott&nbsp;Chacon
    <div class="reading-note">
      I have to admit that I haven't actually read this one&mdash;it was suggested by <a href="http://jasonseifer.com/">Jason Seifer</a>.  Looks like an interesting blog, and as I've said elsewhere on the site, Scott Chacon's knowledge of Git is... impressive.  <strong>(Note:  free blog promoting for-pay book, so I'm listing it in the free section.)</strong>
